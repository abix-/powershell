This repository is currently an unsorted compilation of PowerShell scripts with variable usefulness which I have written during my career as an IT guy. Each script was written to resolve an operational or engineering puzzle. In a perfect world I would have a full description of the puzzle, the constraints, and reasoning into why I wrote the script the way I did.

Clearly, I neither recorded nor remember all the details. My intention with this repository is for it to be a reference for the next guy who comes along. If you did not get here by searching GitHub for a PowerShell cmdlet, I recommend doing this and then checking the Code results. Uncommented code examples are much better than no code examples.

In the future I intend to:
-Upload all my semi-useful scripts
-Stop using .ps1 files and create a module with functions
-Add comments to every function
-Continue to improve random scripts
-Add explanations about the puzzles, constraints, and reasoning
-Commit unfinished useless snippets without explanation

This will never be complete but will always be fun.
